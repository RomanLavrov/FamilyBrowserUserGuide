            <b>Important!</b> You have to turn Revit off before installation.<br />
            Follow the instruction in installer and fill the registration form.
            After installation you can set BUILDing360 template for your project. <br />
            Typically it is located under "C:\ProgramData\Autodesk\RVT 2019\Templates\Generic".<br />

            </div>

            <br/>
            If you can find the tab "Family Browser E" and "Family Browser HVAC" in your ribbon panel - installation was successfully finished.
